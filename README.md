# Hi 👋

I’m Oliver, a junior software developer who enjoys problem-solving and learning new languages, both human and programming ones.

I came to software from a background in Ancient Greek and Latin linguistics, which developed a strong attention to syntax, logic, and structure. That way of thinking is what drew me to programming.

Most of my projects here are small, focused, and built to be reasoned about clearly. I like working through problems carefully, understanding *why* something works, and refining solutions rather than rushing to add features.

I’m currently looking for a junior role where I can keep learning, contribute to a team, and build software that’s genuinely useful.

If you would like to get in touch, feel free to email me.
